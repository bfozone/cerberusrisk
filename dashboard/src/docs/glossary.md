# Glossary

Financial and risk management terms used in CerberusRisk.

---

## A

### Alpha
Excess return of an investment relative to its benchmark, after adjusting for market risk (beta). Positive alpha indicates outperformance.

### Annualized Return
Return scaled to a one-year period using geometric compounding, allowing comparison across different time horizons.

### Asset Class
Category of investments with similar characteristics: equity, fixed income, commodities, alternatives, cash.

---

## B

### Benchmark
Reference index used to evaluate portfolio performance (e.g., S&P 500, Bloomberg Aggregate Bond).

### Beta
Measure of portfolio sensitivity to market movements. Beta of 1.0 means the portfolio moves in line with the market.

---

## C

### Calmar Ratio
Risk-adjusted return metric: Annualized Return / Maximum Drawdown. Higher is better.

### Carbon Intensity
Greenhouse gas emissions relative to revenue, typically measured in tonnes CO2 per million dollars.

### Component VaR
Individual position's contribution to total portfolio VaR, accounting for correlations with other positions.

### Conditional VaR (CVaR)
Also called Expected Shortfall. Average loss in the worst X% of scenarios, beyond the VaR threshold.

### Correlation
Statistical measure of how two assets move together, ranging from -1 (perfect inverse) to +1 (perfect positive).

---

## D

### Dispersion
Spread of returns across portfolios in a composite, typically measured as standard deviation.

### Drawdown
Decline from peak value to trough. Maximum drawdown is the largest such decline in history.

---

## E

### ESG
Environmental, Social, and Governance factors used to evaluate corporate sustainability and ethical impact.

### Excess Return
Portfolio return minus benchmark return, also called active return.

### Expected Shortfall
See Conditional VaR (CVaR).

---

## F

### Factor Exposure
Portfolio sensitivity to systematic risk factors like market, size, value, momentum.

---

## G

### Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
Mathematical model for stock price movements, assuming log-normal distribution. Used in Monte Carlo simulations.

### GIPS
Global Investment Performance Standards. Industry framework for calculating and presenting investment returns.

### Gross Return
Investment return before deducting management fees and expenses.

---

## H

### HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)
Concentration measure calculated as sum of squared weights. Range 0-10,000; higher means more concentrated.

### High Water Mark
Highest value a portfolio has achieved, used as reference for drawdown calculations.

---

## I

### Information Ratio
Active return divided by tracking error. Measures risk-adjusted outperformance vs benchmark.

### Investment Grade
Bonds rated BBB-/Baa3 or higher, considered lower default risk.

---

## K

### Kurtosis
Measure of distribution "tailedness." Excess kurtosis > 0 indicates fatter tails than normal distribution (more extreme events).

---

## L

### Liquidity
Ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without significantly impacting price.

### Log Return
Natural logarithm of price ratio: ln(P_t / P_{t-1}). Preferred for risk calculations as it's additive over time.

---

## M

### Maximum Drawdown
Largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value, expressed as percentage.

### Monte Carlo Simulation
Computational technique using random sampling to model uncertainty and generate probability distributions.

---

## N

### Net Return
Investment return after deducting management fees and expenses.

---

## P

### Percentile
Value below which a given percentage of observations fall. 5th percentile VaR means 5% of returns are worse.

---

## R

### R-Squared (R²)
Proportion of portfolio variance explained by benchmark or factor model. Range 0-1; higher means more systematic risk.

### Risk-Free Rate
Return on a theoretically risk-free investment, typically short-term government bonds. CerberusRisk uses 5%.

### Rolling Window
Moving calculation period (e.g., 20-day rolling volatility recalculates daily using the most recent 20 days).

---

## S

### Sharpe Ratio
Risk-adjusted return: (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Volatility. Higher is better.

### Skewness
Measure of distribution asymmetry. Negative skew means longer left tail (more large losses than gains).

### Sortino Ratio
Like Sharpe, but uses downside deviation instead of total volatility, penalizing only negative returns.

### Standard Deviation
Statistical measure of return dispersion around the mean. When annualized, called volatility.

### Stress Test
Analysis of portfolio performance under hypothetical adverse scenarios.

---

## T

### Tail Risk
Risk of extreme events in the distribution tails, beyond what VaR captures.

### Time-Weighted Return (TWR)
Return calculation that eliminates impact of external cash flows, standard for GIPS compliance.

### Tracking Error
Standard deviation of active returns (portfolio minus benchmark). Measures consistency of over/underperformance.

### Treynor Ratio
Risk-adjusted return: (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Beta. Measures return per unit of systematic risk.

---

## V

### Value at Risk (VaR)
Maximum expected loss at a given confidence level over a specified time period.

### Volatility
Annualized standard deviation of returns, measuring total risk. Expressed as percentage.

---

## W

### WACI
Weighted Average Carbon Intensity. Portfolio-weighted measure of carbon emissions exposure.

### What-If Analysis
Scenario modeling to estimate impact of proposed portfolio changes before execution.
